Over the course of three months, Iâ€™ve learned how to set up Python environments, write efficient code using functions and loops, and apply object-oriented programming concepts. I built interactive projects like the Rock-Paper-Scissors game and a weather app, which helped me apply my knowledge in real-world applications. Working with APIs and creating a user-friendly interface has been a highlight of the program. This journey gave me a comprehensive understanding of Python development from the basics to building fully functional projects.
