1. def clear_screen()
    Purpose: This function is designed to clear the terminal/console screen.
    Explanation:

    The line os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear') checks the operating system type.
    If the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it uses the cls command to clear the screen.
    If it's a Unix-based system (like Linux or macOS), it uses the clear command.

2. [:size*size//2]: The code then slices this list to the first   size * size // 2 elements. For example, if the board size is 4x4, it takes the first 8 letters. If the board is 6x6, it takes the first 18 letters.


3. * 2: The list of letters is duplicated so that each card has a matching pair. For a 4x4 board, this would give you 8 pairs of cards (16 cards total)

4. ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
    And size = 2, the iterations would proceed as follows:
    First iteration (i = 0): cards[0:2] gives ['A', 'B'], which is added to the board.
    Second iteration (i = 1): cards[2:4] gives ['C', 'D'], which is added to the board.
    Third iteration (i = 2): cards[4:6] gives ['E', 'F'], which is added to the board.
    Fourth iteration (i = 3): cards[6:8] gives ['G', 'H'], which is added to the board.


4. enumerate() function:
    The function enumerate() does two things at once:
-----------
    It loops over the items in the list.
    It also keeps track of where you are in the list (i.e., the index).The enumerate() function helps you get both the index and the value (row) at the same time

5. end="":
---------
    This argument in the print() function ensures that printing continues on the same line instead of starting a new line after printing each card.
    After each row is printed, print() without arguments moves to the next lin

6.  all():
---------
    The all() function checks if all elements in an iterable (like a list) are True. If all elements are True, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.
    all(all(row) for row in revealed):
-----------
    This is a nested all() call.
    The inner all(row) checks if every item in the current row is True (meaning all cards in that row are revealed).
    The outer all(...) checks if every row in the revealed list passes this test (i.e., if every card in every row is revealed).
    If all rows are completely revealed (i.e., all elements are True), the function returns True. This means the player has revealed all the cards on the board and won the game.
